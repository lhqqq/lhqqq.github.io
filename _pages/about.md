Hi! I am a first-year PhD student in Computer Science at the University of Texas at Arlington, advised by [Prof. Junzhou Huang](https://ranger.uta.edu/~huang/) in the SMILE Lab. My work focuses on **biometrics (iris/sclera)**, **deepfake detection**, and **medical image analysis**. I won the IJCB 2023 [Best Student Paper Award](https://ijcb2023.ieee-biometrics.org/award-winners/) and the [8th Sclera Segmentation and Recognition Benchmarking Competition (SSRBC 2023)](https://sites.google.com/hyderabad.bits-pilani.ac.in/ssrbc2023/home?pli=1).
